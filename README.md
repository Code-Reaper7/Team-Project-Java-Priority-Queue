# Team-Project-Java-Priority-Queue


# Overview
This project implements a *Priority Queue (APQ)* in Java using an *Expandable Array* data structure.  
It was developed as a team project to practice *data structures and algorithms concepts* and to demonstrate efficient insertion, removal, and ordering of elements by priority.

The repository includes:
- *APQ.java* → Priority Queue implementation  
- *ExpandableArray.java* → Custom expandable array for dynamic resizing  
- *Entry.java* → Defines key-value entry objects  
- *Driver.java* → Test driver for running and validating the APQ  

---

# Features
- *Custom Expandable Array* to support dynamic memory allocation.  
- Efficient *priority-based ordering* of entries.  
- Modular and object-oriented design for clarity and reuse.  
- Fully tested with sample inputs using Driver.java.
